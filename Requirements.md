ðŸ›’ Real-Time Order Processing System (E-Commerce Simulation)
ðŸ§© Description:
Build a simple e-commerce backend that simulates order placement, inventory management, and notification systems â€” all communicating via Kafka topics.

ðŸ§± Microservices (Spring Boot):
Order Service

Accepts new orders (REST API).

Publishes order-created event to Kafka.

Inventory Service

Subscribes to order-created topic.

Checks/updates inventory.

Publishes inventory-updated or inventory-failed.

Notification Service

Listens to inventory-updated and inventory-failed.

Sends email/SMS mock notifications (use logging or dummy service).

(Optional) Analytics Service

Consumes all events for real-time dashboard/analytics (e.g., order volume, failure rate).

ðŸ“Œ Kafka Topics Example:
order-created

inventory-updated

inventory-failed

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:
Spring Boot (Web, Kafka, Data JPA)

Apache Kafka (local with Docker)

H2 or PostgreSQL (Order & Inventory persistence)

Optional: Redis for caching, Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring

ðŸ”¥ Why this is great:
Involves event-driven communication, retry strategies, and idempotency.

Helps you understand Kafka producer/consumer setup, message formats (Avro/JSON), and error handling.

Youâ€™ll touch on real-world concerns like service decoupling, message ordering, and scalability.

Would you like me to help you outline the folder structure or give you starter code for this?
